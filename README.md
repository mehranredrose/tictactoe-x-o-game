# tictactoe-x-o-game

Here I'm going to make the tictactoe game or the x/o game !<br />

the winnig condition is to make a triple of x (or o) in a row or coloumn or diametrical !<br />

we have several steps for making, that I explain them below :<br />
1.getting input for loop!(yes or no for playing ;)<br />
2.showing Board structure.<br />
3.getting input for 9 values !(it's for starting the game with user ,I'll update the game soon ;)<br />
4.computer move!<br />
5.user move! and comuter ...<br />
6.does any body wins ? if not , is there any free space to go on ? else its equal!<br />
7.posting the result of the game !<br />

the algorithm for the will be:<br />
.input<br />
2.designing board<br />
3.isfreespace method<br /> 
4.iswinner method<br />
5.player move<br />
6.computer move<br />
7.main logic<br />
8.interface <br />
