# TicTacToe (x-o Game)
The program is to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game in single player mode. In single player mode we have used game theory logics like minimax algorithms to determine the best move that the computer plays.

we have several steps to make:<br />
1.getting input for loop!(yes or no for playing ;)<br />
2.showing Board structure.<br />
3.getting input for 9 values !(it's for starting the game with user ,I'll update the game soon ;)<br />
4.computer move!<br />
5.user move! and comuter ...<br />
6.does any body wins ? if not , is there any free space to go on ? else its equal!<br />
7.posting the result of the game !<br />

# Algorithm of program:<br />
.input<br />
2.designing board<br />
3.isfreespace method<br /> 
4.iswinner method<br />
5.player move<br />
6.computer move<br />
7.main logic<br />
8.interface <br />
